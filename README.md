## Usage

Upload a Game Boy or Game Boy Color ROM, along with a copy of the Game Boy Color BIOS, often called gbc_bios.bin - The BIOS is necessary due to the accuracy focus of the emulator. Once those are uploaded, the game can be played using keyboard controls, which can be remapped to your liking in the options menu. During gameplay you can minimize the options menu by clicking "hide options".
